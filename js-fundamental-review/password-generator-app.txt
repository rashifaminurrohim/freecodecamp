Build a Password Generator App
In this lab, you'll practice using functions by building a random password generator.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a function called generatePassword that takes a parameter, indicating the length of generated password. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. You should use the following string and different Math methods to help you return a new string with random characters in it: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*().
You should define a variable called password and assign it the result of calling the generatePassword function with a numeric argument that represents the desired password length.
You should have a console.log that logs a single string made by concatenating the message Generated password: and the password variable separated by a space.
